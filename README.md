# 09 Professional README Generator

This assignment about building an app to automate the creation of README files with the purpose of saving time to programmers. The application is developed with Node.js and it is run in the terminal. It is only necessary for the user to fill out a simple questionnaire and the README file will be generated automatically.

Inside the Repository you can find an automatically generated sample README file named sample_README.
To better understanding of the process I invite you to watch the following video
